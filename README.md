## Portfolio website

The reason I created this website was for searching a front-end position. On this website, information and links to my projects are included. Potential employer could evaluate my
technical skills based on those projects.

## Tech stack (libraries) used:

- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Email JS
- React Hook Form
